# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Setup Tantivy search engine integration
  - Create Tantivy schema for book indexing with fields for book_id, title, author, genre, publication_date, content, and chapter_titles
  - Implement TantivySearchEngine struct with methods for search_full_text, search_with_filters, add_document, update_document, and delete_document
  - Add Tantivy dependency to Cargo.toml and configure build settings
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 2. Implement advanced query parsing system
  - Create QueryParser struct that can parse different query types (simple, boolean, phrase, regex, fuzzy)
  - Implement ParsedQuery structure to represent parsed search queries with filters and options
  - Add support for boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and phrase matching with quotes
  - Create SearchFilters struct for author, genre, date range, reading status, and collection filtering
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 3. Build fuzzy search capabilities
  - Implement FuzzySearchEngine with similarity calculation using Levenshtein distance
  - Create fuzzy matching algorithm with configurable threshold (default 0.8)
  - Add suggestion generation for typos and variations using edit distance
  - Integrate fuzzy search with main search pipeline for error-tolerant queries
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Create multi-level caching system
  - Implement SearchCache with L1 LRU cache for 1000 most recent queries
  - Add optional Redis L2 cache integration for distributed caching
  - Create cache invalidation strategy based on book modification events
  - Implement TTL management (1 hour for search results, 24 hours for indices)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement search history and analytics
  - Create SearchAnalytics struct to record search metrics, cache hits/misses, and performance data
  - Build search history storage with user-specific query tracking (last 20 searches)
  - Implement PerformanceMetrics collection for average response time, cache hit rate, and popular queries
  - Add search pattern analysis for optimization insights
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 6. Build real-time search with performance optimization
  - Implement real-time search with sub-100ms response time for basic queries
  - Create search result ranking algorithm based on relevance scores
  - Add search result highlighting with before/after context extraction
  - Implement pagination and lazy loading for large result sets
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive error handling and recovery
  - Implement SearchError enum with specific error types for query parsing, indexing, caching, and timeouts
  - Add graceful degradation from Tantivy to basic text search on failures
  - Create retry logic for index operations with exponential backoff
  - Implement search timeout handling with 5-second maximum duration
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Implement search service integration layer
  - Create SearchService trait with methods for search_books, search_content, get_suggestions, get_search_history, build_index, and update_index
  - Implement AdvancedSearchService that coordinates between Tantivy, fuzzy search, and caching
  - Add background indexing for new books without blocking UI
  - Create incremental indexing for modified book content
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1_

- [ ] 9. Add comprehensive testing suite
  - Write unit tests for query parsing, fuzzy matching, and caching components
  - Create integration tests for full search pipeline with test book data
  - Implement performance tests to verify sub-100ms response times for basic queries and sub-500ms for complex queries
  - Add load tests for concurrent search scenarios with 100+ simultaneous users
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 10. Integrate with existing book service and UI
  - Connect AdvancedSearchService with existing BookService for book metadata access
  - Update search UI components to use new search capabilities with real-time results
  - Implement search suggestions dropdown with autocomplete functionality
  - Add search filters UI for author, genre, date range, and reading status
  - Create search history UI panel with quick access to recent searches
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
