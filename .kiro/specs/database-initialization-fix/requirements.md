# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the database initialization error that prevents the ePub Reader application from starting. The error "unable to open database file" occurs because the SQLite database file and directory structure are not properly created during application startup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to start successfully without database errors, so that I can use the ePub Reader immediately after installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts for the first time THEN the system SHALL create the necessary database directory structure
2. WHEN the database file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create a new SQLite database file with proper permissions
3. WHEN the database exists but is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and recreate the database
4. WHEN the application starts THEN all required database tables SHALL be created automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database initialization and migration handling, so that the application can evolve without breaking existing user data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check the database schema version
2. WHEN schema migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL apply them automatically
3. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN the database is locked THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work across different operating systems, so that I can use it on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on any supported OS THEN the database SHALL be stored in the appropriate user data directory
2. WHEN the user data directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with proper permissions
3. WHEN there are permission issues THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
4. WHEN the database path is invalid THEN the system SHALL fallback to a temporary location

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be safe and recoverable, so that I don't lose my library and reading progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL create automatic backups
2. WHEN corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover from the most recent backup
3. WHEN backup restoration fails THEN the system SHALL allow starting with a fresh database
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the database SHALL be properly closed and synced
